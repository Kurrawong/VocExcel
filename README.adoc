= VocExcel
:toc:

Another Excel-to-RDF converter for SKOS vocabs, but one that:

* uses fixed templates to keep it simple
* meets particular SKOS profile outcomes (https://linked.data.gov.au/def/vocpub[VocPub])
* is under active development, production use, and is commercially supported

An online version of VocExcel is available at https://tools.dev.kurrawong.ai/vocexcel.

== Creating vocabularies

The process to create an RDF vocabulary from an Excel template is:

1. Fill in a copy of an Excel template
2. Process it
** Using one of the options, and export an RDF file
** You can choose to validate the RDF produced while processing

=== Templates

The template files in this repository's *vocexcel/templates/* folder are to be used to create vocabularies. The templates hopefully contain all the information needed to understand how to fill them in.

Use one Excel workbook per vocabulary.

=== Latest Template

* **vocexcel/templates/VocExcel-template-085.xlsx**

Unless you have a good reason to do something different, please use the latest version of the template.

Older templates still convert, so if you've used one and like it, keep using it.

=== Examples

Example filled-in templates versions are given in the `tests/data/` folder. Just ensure you're looking at examples prefixed with the same template version you are after, e.g. 0.8.5 = 085.xlsx.

As per _semantic versioning_, a template of 0.8.2 will work with 0.8.5. 

== Processing

To process an Excel template, you will need to either:

* run the VocExcel Python script, or
* use an online tool
** for example https://tools.kurrawong.ai/tools/vocexcel

The Python script can also run as a Python module, i.e. within a larger Python workflow.

=== Installation

You will need to:

1. have Python installed on your computer
* 3.10+ required
2. install the required packages in your main Python environment or a virtual environment
    * you can use the https://docs.astral.sh/uv/[uv] tool Python build tool with the _pyproject.toml_ file to install required Python packages

=== Running

==== As a command line script

The Python script `convert.py` in the `vocexcel/` directory can be run on Windows/Unix/Linux/Mac systems like this:

----
python convert.py some-excel-file.xlsx
----

If you install this program using a Python packaging tool such as uv, then it will run like this:

----
vocexel some-excel-file.xlsx
----

An example, using one of the test data files to convert from Excel to RDF:

----
python convert.py tests/data/085.xlsx
----

To convert the other way - RDF to Excel - from with you'll get a v0.8.x template result:

----
python convert.py tests/data/085_rdf.ttl
----

The command line argument options can be found by typing:

----
python convert.py -h
----

They are:

----
usage: vocexcel [-h] [-i] [-o OUTPUTFILE] [input_file]

positional arguments:
  input_file            The Excel file to convert to a SKOS vocabulary in RDF or an RDF file to convert to an Excel file. (default: None)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --info            The version and other info of this instance of VocExcel. (default: False)
  -o OUTPUTFILE, --outputfile OUTPUTFILE
                        An optionally-provided output file path. If not provided, output from Excel-> RDF is to standard out and RDF->Excel is input file with .xlsx file ending. (default: None)
----

==== As a Python library

The _convert.py_ file uses the functions `excel_to_rdf()` and `rdf_to_excel()` to do conversions, so you can directly them in other Python programs by importing them like:

----
from vocexcel.convert import excel_to_rdf, rdf_to_excel
from pathlib import Path

rdf_to_excel(Path(".") / "path" / "to" / "vocab-file.xlsx")

# or

excel_to_rdf(Path(".") / "path" / "to" / "vocab-file.ttl")
----
